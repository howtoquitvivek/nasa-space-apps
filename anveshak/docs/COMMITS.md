# Anveshak Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a clear and organized version control history, we will adhere to the following commit message format. A consistent and well-defined commit history is invaluable for collaboration, code reviews, and understanding the evolution of the project.

## General Principles

- **Be Descriptive, Not Just Restrictive:** The goal of these guidelines is to create a more informative and navigable commit history, not to create unnecessary work.
- **Think of Your Future Self (and Others):** A good commit message saves time and effort when you're trying to understand why a change was made weeks or months later.
